        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Venkateswaran S, an electronics engineer with a passion for blending hardware design and biological sciences. I recently graduated with dual majors in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Biological Sciences from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.</p>

<p>I have gained hands-on experience in the industry through internships at NVIDIA, where I worked on memory subsystem verification, and at Nihon Communication Solutions, where I contributed to mobile ad hoc network architectures. Presently, I’m a Hardware Engineer at Cenizas Labs, involved in the development of real-time power management systems.</p>

<p>Outside of the lab, I have a passion for teaching and public speaking. I’ve taught workshops on Serial Cloner and actively participated in Toastmasters, where I served as Vice President of Public Relations. My hobbies range from table tennis and chess to exploring Japanese and Chinese art forms. I've also been recognized for my innovative thinking, receiving national awards like the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Ignite Award for my work on creating impactful, problem-solving innovations.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work and interests. I’m always open to collaborations and discussions on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible!</p>
