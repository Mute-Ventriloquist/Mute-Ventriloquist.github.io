        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Venkateswaran S, a multidisciplinary student currently pursuing a dual degree in Biological Sciences and Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. My academic journey bridges the gap between biology and electronics, with a keen interest in neuromorphic computing, biomolecular modeling, and embedded systems.

I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects, from designing memristor-based neuromorphic systems to studying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These experiences have given me a broad skill set, enabling me to tackle complex problems with a unique perspective.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’ve held internships at Nihon Communication Solutions and Larsen & Toubro Histopathology Lab, where I contributed to fields as varied as mobile ad hoc network communication and ocular surface cancer research. I've also been recognized for my innovative thinking, receiving national awards like the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Ignite Award for my work on creating impactful, problem-solving innovations.

Outside of the lab, I have a passion for teaching and public speaking. I’ve taught workshops on Serial Cloner and actively participated in Toastmasters, where I served as Vice President of Public Relations. My hobbies range from table tennis and chess to exploring Japanese and Chinese art forms.

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work and interests. I’m always open to collaborations and discussions on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible!</p>
